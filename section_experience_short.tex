    {Apr 2014} {Action/Behavior Recognition in Videos}{ZJU}{ Matlab}
    {Feb 2014} {
          \begin{itemize}
                        \item Extract the spatio-temporal features and obtain "Bag of words" represetation by clustering (k-means) the extracted features;
                        \item Infer the posterior by pLSA/LDA (unsupervised Learning) or by simple classfications (KNN, SVM);
                        \item Propose a simple method called 'voting' to achieve multiple actions recogintion task.
