{\textbf{Bio.}}
I am currently a 4th-year PhD Student at College of ISEE, Zhejiang University, China,
 working with Chunguang Li on Variational Bayesian Algorithms and their applications in Distributed Systems.

{\textbf{Research interests.}}
My Ph.D research work covers a range of issues: \textbf{variational Bayesian inference,
stochastic/distributed optimization, probabilistic graphical models, transfer learning, multitask learning
and sensor networks}. Currently, I am interesting in varies approaches to deep learning (CNN, GAN, Deep Bayesian Learning, etc.)
and their applications to computer vision (image processing, video analysis, etc.).
