{\textbf{Bio.}} 
I am currently a PhD Student at College of ISEE, Zhejiang University, China, 
 working with Chunguang Li on Variational Bayesian Algorithms and their applications in Distributed Systems. 

{\textbf{Research interests.}} 
My Ph.D research work covers a range of issues: \textbf{variational Bayesian inference, 
stochastic/distributed optimization, probabilistic graphical models, transfer learning, multitask learning 
and sensor networks}. Currently, I am interesting in varies approaches to deep learning (CNN, GAN, Deep Bayesian Learning, etc.) 
and their applications to computer vision (image processing, video analysis, etc.).
